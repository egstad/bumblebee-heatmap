## Install

1. Clone the repo, cd into directory
2. `npm install` to install dependencies (parcel.js, heatmap.js)
3. `npm start`

## How to use

1. Cursor movement "paints" the heat-map
2. By default, background images are hidden. Crack open `index.html` and add 'em if you want.
3. Press `r` to restart drawing
4. Press `Enter` to save drawing (saved as `.png`).
5. Fuck with the variables found in `index.js` for a good time.
6. Have fun!
